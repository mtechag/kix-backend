This API can be used to communicate with the KIX backend (core) application. It has been designed with respect to the structure and relationships of the internal business objects. 

At this stage it is not intended to be a perfect REST API following any concept out there. Therefore it doesn't support full discoverability yet and also not all response headers (like counts etc.) are available. 

Nonetheless it's an extremely powerful API to support any client-to-server communication necessary to handle KIX. Additionally it can easily be expanded by extensions.
